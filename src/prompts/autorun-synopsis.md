Provide a brief synopsis of what you just accomplished in this task using this exact format:

**Summary:** [1-2 sentences describing the key outcome]

**Details:** [A paragraph with more specifics about what was done, files changed, etc.]

Rules:
- Be specific about what was actually accomplished, not what was attempted.
- Focus only on meaningful work that was done. Omit filler phrases like "the task is complete", "no further action needed", "everything is working", etc.
- NEVER include preamble about session context, interaction history, or caveats like "This is our first interaction", "there's no prior work to summarize", "you asked me to", etc. Jump straight to the accomplishment.
- Start directly with the action taken (e.g., "Fixed button visibility..." not "You asked me to fix...").
- If nothing meaningful was accomplished (no code changes, no files modified, no research completed, just greetings or introductions), respond with ONLY the text: NOTHING_TO_REPORT
- Use NOTHING_TO_REPORT when the conversation was just a greeting, introduction, or there genuinely was no work to summarize.
